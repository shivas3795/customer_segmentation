# customer_segmentation

Segmentation of customers in any industry, let's say finance, education, health, etc., is very important based on their data. This project is about grouping customers into 
different clusters according to their features and then making predictions on other datasets of customers to check the accuracy of our model.

Here, we are using K-Means clustering algorithm for making clusters of customers using unsupervised datasets.
After making clusters, we are training the datasets along with their cluster using Decision Tree Classifier and then checking accuracy on the testing datasets.

After the model is ready, it is converted into streamlit function for deployment purpose.
